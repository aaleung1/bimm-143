## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure is called the PDB found at :http://www.rcsb.org/

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type.



```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")

pdbstats
```
The commas in the numbers is causing data to be converted to character data instead of numeric.


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

This can be fixed by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function:
```{r}
x <-pdbstats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric( sub(",","",x) ) )
```

Or I can use the `readr` package and the `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
##install.packages("readr")
library("readr")
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```
Percentage of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```
Percentage of EM structures
```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

Percentage of protein structures
```{r}
df[1,]$total/sum(df$total) * 100
```



> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 231,029 HIV-1 structures in the current PDB.

## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at :https://molstar.org/viewer/
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code).

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We see just one atom per water molecule in this structure because both hydrogens are involved in hydrogen bonding and show as sticks in a ball and stick representation.


> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

Yes, this water molecule is HOH308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R


We can use the **biod3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB into R.

```{r}
library(bio3d)


pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 chains, A and B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` and `install.packages("shiny")`

```{r}
library(r3dmol)
library(shiny)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large scale functional motions of biomolecules.


```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
